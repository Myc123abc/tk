A game engine for making galgame, currently I need to learn many things.

TODO:
* ffmpeg with miniaudio play music
* make a music player as example (use fftw for audio visualization, create own fftw repo for git submodule)
* ffmpeg play video
* make kanon in source code
* read game engine architecture
* abstract kanon making process to form galgame engine base architecture
* rich base function for galgame engine
* consider extre advance feature like "real rain" in 魔法使いの夜
* consider depth, 3D, light, particle effects, physics collision, etc.

reserve:
* freetype not read GPOS for kerning, you can use HarfBuzz.
